          ><p>Dear Committee members,



<p>I’m pleased to present my file for continuing appointment as Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at SUNY Potsdam.  I have been a faculty member in SUNY Potsdam’s Computer Science Department since Jan 2017, first an instructor and then, upon completion of my PhD thesis in Aug 2018, as an Assistant Professor.

<p>During my time at SUNY Potsdam, I have been an active participant in overhauling the department’s offering at every level and in transforming our curriculum.  I have offered 12 different courses, including 4 new offerings, during my 6 years in the department.  These courses have all continually improved and evolved to keep up with the tremendous progress being made in the field of computer science and based on the feedback received from students and peers.  At the degree level, to ensure that our graduates are well-prepared for the job opportunities of the future, I was instrumental in envisioning and deploying a new track in data analytics and helped the design and development of another track on computer security.  I worked with the curriculum committees at the school and university level to get the track approved and we are now awaiting final approval from SUNY.  The initial offering of the electives from the tracks have been well received by our students and the overall success of our program is reflected in the success our graduates have seen in securing internships and job offers from leading companies in our field.

<p>Active participation in research has enabled me to keep up with the progress in the field.  My research has focused on the role of AI/ML and Big Data on indoor air quality, and my work has resulted in the publication of 3 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals and two more being submitted this Spring.  Additionally, I have had 19 presentations in national/international conferences, workshops and seminars.  My research has involved our undergraduate students and external collaborators.  In addition, I was co-PI on several proposals to federal and state funding agencies.  In the coming years, I expect to receive external funding to support my research activities and help increase the involvement of our undergraduates in my research.  

<p>My role as a faculty member is incomplete without providing service to my community.  In the department, amongst other activities, I have taken a keen interest in active academic advising of ~ 20 student annually and volunteering to guide 13 senior design projects so far.  The outcomes of these activities have been very rewarding for students and me.  I was my department’s delegate in the Senate and am also serving on five university committees, one of which I chaired.  I am also on the advisory board of two external research programs led by St. Lawrence Health Systems (SLHS).  

<p>Full details of my teaching, research, and service activities are available in this webpage.  

<p>I am very grateful to be a part of the SUNY Potsdam community and I am extremely fortunate to have had the support of the department, school, and the university during my years as an Assistant Professor here.  I eagerly look forward to the review of my tenure file and continuing my activities with renewed vigor after this process.



<p>Sincerely
<p>Supraja Gurajala

          <p>As a faculty member at SUNY Potsdam for six years, I have had the privilege to pursue my passion for teaching through twelve different courses and my love for teaching has only intensified. I have had the opportunity to impact the growth and development of undergraduate students at all levels, from freshmen to seniors, and have seen them grow into confident professionals. I am eager to further build on my teaching career and continue to positively influence my students.

		<p>The field of computer science is continually evolving, and it is essential to keep our courses updated to prepare students for industry jobs and/or graduate school. To address this need, I led the development of a new Data Analytics track and helped in the creation of a new track in Computer Security.  For the Data Analytics track, I designed, developed, and offered two new courses: Machine Learning and Data Analysis and Visualization and redesigned the third course, Database System incorporating advances in the field. For the Computer Security track, I worked with Prof. Ladd to design the track and was fully responsible for one new course, Cryptography. I played a crucial role in the approval process for both tracks, working closely with committees at all levels of the university, and we are currently awaiting final approval from SUNY.

		<p>In recent semesters, I taught 7 different courses: CIS 201 Computer Science 1 (including lecture, lab and recitation), CIS 301 Theory of Computation, CIS 325 Data Analysis and Visualization, CIS 410 Computer Networks, and CIS 420 Database Systems, CIS 431 Machine Learning, and CIS 475 Introduction to Cryptography.  These courses have been regularly revised considering changes in the field and student/peer feedback.  Some of these revisions include incorporation of Big Data concepts and projects in the Database course, personalized assignments and exams in my cryptography course, introduction of a lab for the Computer Networks course, and inclusion of projects and research paper reviews in all 400-level courses. The changes were aimed at incorporating a practical aspect into courses that are otherwise predominantly theoretical.

		<p>To foster active student participation and maintain high attendance rates, I introduced pop-up quizzes in class. Emphasizing group projects in all upper division courses, I focus on promoting peer-to-peer collaboration and communication to align with the expectations of industrial settings. Additionally, I use real-world examples to strengthen students' understanding, such as utilizing publicly available data in fields like cars, weather, and real estate in my data analytics and machine learning courses. It is gratifying to receive feedback from students that these techniques are preparing them well for internships and careers, as noted by one of our students (Eric Zair, Class of 2020) in his interview for SUNY Potsdam’s CS <a href="https://www.potsdam.edu/academics/AAS/depts/CS/Zair"style="color:white;" target="_blank">Web page (hover mouse for link).</a>   

		<p>During the early months of the pandemic, when we had to transition our courses to online offering at short notice, I chose to conduct my classes asynchronously, with the assumption that my students can pace and access the course according to their situation at home while maximizing learning. This transition was aided by my prior attendance of CCI workshop in early Spring 2020, where new technologies for online education were introduced to us.  I incorporated learnings from that workshop in my online offering and posted weekly pre-recorded lectures, related short quizzes, and associated homeworks.  Additionally, I was available for 3 hours of office hours on all weekdays on Discord (Computer Science department server) for students to “stop by” and discuss any questions they had.  My goal was to recreate or even exceed the in-person experience that the students were used to.

		<p>At the end of the Spring 2020 semester, however, I realized that the lack of regular structured interaction with students affected student-learning and my teaching experience.  During summer 2020 I attended an online pedagogy course (session 5) offered on campus to facilitate development of knowledge, skills and attributes for effective online teaching and learning. For Fall 2020, I made a “course-correction” by switching to synchronous offering.  This change resulted in a course that was much closer to my regular in-person offering.  The student feedback was very positive for this change.

		<p>The change in the mode of teaching to online from in-person benefited students in many ways, including with access to recorded lectures after class and being able to electronically “walk-in” to my office hours via discord.  Some students, however, found this transition a bit challenging, and in their evaluations noted that the Fall 2020 semester was stressful and overwhelming.  Recognizing that students face a diverse set of challenges that are not easily evident to me, I’ve been encouraging regular contact through office hours and was open to some flexibility in deadlines.  

		<p>Some of the pandemic-driven changes in my teaching have become part of my offering when we got back to in-person teaching. As an example, I am using tablets for lecturing, so I can face my students while teaching and post recordings after class, and continue to use discord for office hours, in addition to face-to-face meetings, to provide flexibility in how students reach me.
 
		<p>As an educator, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality and impactful lessons that foster student engagement and success. My commitment to improvement is evident in the positive evaluations from my students and peers who observe my classes. I take their feedback seriously and make thoughtful adjustments to my teaching style and course content to enhance the learning experience for my students.

		<p>In addition to imparting knowledge, creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment is equally important. I strive to provide a safe space where all students feel comfortable to express themselves, regardless of their individual identities and comfort levels. To achieve this, I approach my students with respect, encourage open communication and discussion, and actively promote a respectful and inclusive atmosphere in my classroom. This ensures that all students feel valued, heard and supported in their learning journey.

          <p>My research interests are in the fields of Big Data, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.  As often noted, Data is the new oil; while mining data can be economically valuable, this resource must be handled carefully.  Using machine learning and advanced data analytics, we can extract information and intelligence from the vast amount of data being generated.  However, care must be taken in how we build and use our models.  If these models are going to play an important role in our criminal justice system, health-care industry, and in maintenance of public safety, it is critical that we have a full understanding of the performance characteristics of these models. 

		<p>I have been actively involved in research projects in these fields, working closely with undergraduate students in our department, and collaborating with faculty and graduate students in Clarkson University.

		<p>Since joining SUNY Potsdam, my research output has included 15 international/national conference presentations, 3 publications in peer-reviewed journals, 1 submitted for review, and 1 submitted as preprint to an open archive.  I co-organized an international workshop on data analytics that was attended by over 25 researchers from reputable institutions around the world including Cornell University.  I have also presented 3 department seminars in SUNY Potsdam.  

		<p>A research project that is special to me is a recent one with our own undergraduate student, Brandon Beattie.  This project used machine learning (ML) to automatically analyze and classify submissions made to the American Association of Aerosol Research (AAAR) conferences over 20 years.  Using natural language processing, database management, and ML classification algorithms, we were able to classify publications into topics that were automatically-generated and then determine how topics evolved over time.  This work was presented as a platform presentation at the 2022 AAAR conference in Raleigh, NC and is currently being written up for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

		<p>Some of my other research projects are focused on the role of Big Data in air quality.  Air pollution is one of the leading causes of global disease, and increasingly our knowledge of the neighborhood air quality is obtained from low-cost air sensor networks.  The quality of this network data must be evaluated and analyzed to ensure it is acceptable for making policy.  In one project, using advanced statistical analysis, we were able to show that the low-cost sensor data does not capture the contribution of all air pollution sources equally.  In another project, using advanced data analytic techniques, we studied the connection between air quality exposure and severity of COVID-19 disease.  Related to these projects, I published one manuscript and submitted another one for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.  I have also presented research related to both these projects in several conferences, including multiple American Association for Aerosol Research conferences, Air Sensors International Conference and in Research and Projects Showcase conference in Clarkson University. Most recently, our work was presented in Air Sensors International Conference in May 2022 and in American Association for Aerosol Research conferences Oct 2022. 

		<p>I have been actively looking to find funding for my research activities.  I submitted proposals to several funding agencies including: NYSERDA, NSF and HEI for supporting data analysis for a large air quality network.  While those proposals did not get funded, my recent research progress in related fields as demonstrated by publications and conference presentations should place us well in an upcoming proposal we are planning. 

		<p>Academic research has been a profound learning experience for me. I have honed my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, and come to understand the significance of meticulous and in-depth investigation. Collaboration and interdisciplinary methods proved to be crucial in finding solutions, and I came to appreciate the need for ethical considerations in any research endeavor. I am grateful for the opportunity to engage in academic research, which has been a valuable learning experience.

            <div class="line-dec"></div>
          </div>

          <p>Service is an important way for faculty to give back to their community.  I have had the opportunity to serve my community at the department, school, university, and professional level.  While participation in these different service activities has necessitated significant time commitment, this experience has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the academic issues within the university and also appreciate the larger social concerns of our campus community. 
			<p>Some of my specific service activities include:
			<ul >
            <li><p>Participating in six committees at school and university level that shape institutional policies and procedures.</li>
			<li><p>Mentoring and advising students on senior projects, internships, and curriculum.</li>
			<li><p>Expanding curriculum by developing new tracks.</li>
			<li><p>Playing an active role in local community development activities.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>At the department level, my services included: design and development of new tracks for our B.S. program, active participation in board meetings, presentation of seminars, advise senior projects, and provide academic student advising.  A few years after I joined the department, I recommended that we modernize our curriculum and offer new tracks consistent with where the field was headed. Upon receiving enthusiastic approval from my colleagues, I initiated the design of the data analytics track, and over the last three years, I successfully created and launched three new courses integral to the track. Also, I have worked closely with my colleague, Dr. Ladd, to design a second track, one on Computer Security, including being responsible for developing a new elective.  I worked with all of the curriculum and business affairs committees from the department to the university level to get these tracks approved and we are now awaiting final approval from SUNY.  

		<p>As a part of our BS/BA program students must do a Capstone project (Senior project or internship) to graduate.  I advised 13 students (55 credits) in the last six years towards this.  Although these credits are on top of our full-time teaching load, it is very rewarding to see that these projects have led to students getting jobs and even a presentation at a recent prestigious international conference. With my academic advising role involving ~ 20 students, I am able to closely observe and aid the growth of my students and ensure their success.  Recognizing the importance of this role especially during the pandemic, I have been very flexible with video conferencing meetings and availability outside of office hours. 

		<p>I am invested in enhancing students' experiences during their university studies.  That has meant, among other activities, active advising of the Association of Computing Machinery - Women (ACM-W) club.  I attended all their meetings and events and took students to off-campus conferences. I closely worked with the students for the recent ACM NYCWIC conference and was thrilled to see them win a best poster award. While the pandemic put a stop to our club activities, I am now planning on restarting them. I also co-led a resume workshop for students with other faculty members to improve their job prospects.

		<p>I have been an active participant in all of our Board of Advisors meetings to ensure that our external advisors have a comprehensive understanding of our activities and can contribute to the growth of our program. Prior to the pandemic, I played a key role in leading the department's participation in events such as open houses and Major Affairs to inform prospective students and attract those who are undecided in their major to our program.

		<p>At the school level I’m an active member of Arts and Sciences Curriculum Committee (ASCC) and Arts and Sciences Council (ASC).  Through ASCC, I gained invaluable insight into the course offerings at our school while reviewing numerous course proposals. This experience helped me design a new data analytics track for our BS program and contribute to the development of another track focused on computer security. Membership in the Arts and Sciences Council (ASC) has allowed me to better understand the issues in the arts and sciences community, and to work collaboratively to find solutions.

		<p>At the University level, I serve or have served on the Faculty Senate since May 2019, as the chair of the Student Affairs committee (SAC), a member of the Faculty Executive committee, member of Academic Programs and Curriculum Committee (APCC), and member of the Business Affairs Committee (BAC). Through these committees, I have had the opportunity to contribute to shared governance at the University and address critical matters. A couple examples include: as Chair of the Student Affairs Committee, I collaborated with campus life and faculty volunteers to establish a buddy-voting system to support student voting during the 2020 elections; and On the recommendation of the Faculty Executive Committee, I worked with Dr. Grabowski to create an emergency communication service for the university community, with the first application for use in the 2020 elections. 

		<p>The past few years have presented many challenges, including the pandemic, social unrest, and the university’s challenging economic situation. My involvement in various committees has allowed me to witness the university community come together and work selflessly to address these challenges and further our efforts towards diversity, equity, and inclusion.  One related effort was my role in aiding the Student Affairs Committee compile a report on available campus resources to address COVID-related health issues such as stress, anxiety, grief, and mental health among students.  

		<p>At a professional level, my responsibilities have included: co-advising graduate students, serving as a reviewer for journal papers, and presenting and organizing workshops and seminars. I recently co-organized a 5-day international workshop on Sensors and Data Analytics at Clarkson University. I am dedicated to keeping our department up-to-date on the latest research activities and opportunities in the fields related to ML and Big Data by giving seminars in the department and also inviting external experts to make presentations.

		<p>At the community level, I am part of the advisory boards for two projects run by St Lawrence Health Systems and supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). I bring a patient's perspective to one project (PCORI-CTD-ILD: Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease) and serve as a stakeholder advisor on another (PCORI-DISRUPTS: Developing InfraStructure for Research to Utilize Patient-centered Techniques). Additionally, I assisted in organizing public health seminars for the St. Lawrence community, with the most recent seminar on "Vax vs Fiction" attracting a large turnout.

		<p>I also play an active role in the village community through my mentorship with the Friends of India Association (FIA). FIA connects students, staff, and community members with an interest in Indian culture and provides support to new students from India when they arrive in Potsdam. In my role as a mentor, I help with club organization and planning and play a key role in organizing FIA's annual Diwali event.

		<p>Overall, my involvement in various service activities has provided me with a more comprehensive understanding of the current challenges and opportunities within our community. These experiences have also allowed me to cultivate strong relationships with colleagues from across the campus and with my students. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to further my service activities and to maintain a positive impact on the academic community.
